Github is a really awesome tool. It's where most open source
project live.
In my case, I use github as a means of control and tracking. I've
been doing so many projects in my free time, but however I do not
have a record or something that can show what I've been doing. For
example, I made a game a couple of years ago, but somehow lost the
code. So I can't actually state that I've made a game.

Github too works really well with Kicad. Kicad is an electronic
schematic capture and pcb design tool. It works well because kicad
stores all of its files in text format. Thus github is a good way
to manage my circuits.

Github, I believe will also help me keep a track of where I'm
coming from and where I'm going. I've discovered recently that
using github make me use it even more.
