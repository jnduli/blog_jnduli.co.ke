Github is a really awesome tool. It's where most open source
project live.
In my case, I use github as a means of control and tracking. I've
been doing so many projects in my free time, but however I do not
have a record or something that can show what I've been doing. For
example, I made a game a couple of years ago, but somehow lost the
code. So I can't actually state that I've made a game.

Github, I believe will also help me keep a track of where I'm
coming from and where I'm going. I've discovered recently that
using github make me use it even more.
