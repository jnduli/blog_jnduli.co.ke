I've tried to figure out what I value and do introspection into this and I'm
slowly getting to understand myself

Consistency
-----------
I believe consistency trumps all. A story I like is about a professor that split
his class into two, one who would work to take a perfect picture and be graded
only on this picture, and another who would be graded on the number of pictures.
The team that was graded on the number of pictures produced many more quality
pictures than the other since they'd been regularly practicing the skills to do
this.

I apply this by doing what I've planned, no matter how I feel and how crap I
feel like. This means one day I'll barely achieve anything, but on another day
I'll be able to get a alot done, but on average I'm implicitly building up this
skill. This also means I value getting out to do something rather than get the
perfect thing to do.

Here are some examples:
- I code in a language I'm learning everyday using codewars.
- I try to do a leetcode problem every day, it doesn't matter whether I'm able
  to do it or not.
- I write something for my blog/comic every day.
- I do some exercise every morning.


Leave it Better Than I found It
-------------------------------
This applies to a lot of things but isn't quite practical. I'll try to leave
rooms cleaner than I found them, leave docs better than I found them and leave
code better than I found it. It always doesn't work out but the attempt is what
counts to me. This way, I end up improving and becoming better over time.



Integrity

Document Everything
-------------------


- Write it down:
- Don't overcomplicate it, especially when starting out:
