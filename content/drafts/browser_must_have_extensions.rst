I end up setting up my browser from scratch every time I need to set it up, but
I always end up missing some extension or some configurations. Here's the list
of my must have extension and configurations for browsers.

Firefox:

.. TODO: add links to this

+ Dark Reader
+ Tab Counter
+ Tridactyl
+ uBlock Origin
+ LeechBlock NG
+ Remove YouTube Suggestions
+ SponsorBlock for YouTube - Skip Sponsor
+ Firefox Mult-Account Containers

.. TODO: add list of configs
Look at configs that I've changed.
