Title: Improvements to Suggest

When I start on a new project or take up ownership of one there are some thing I
like to look out for. Here's the list:

- backups and backup testing procedure
- CI/CD set up and metrics:
  - how fast are our pipelines?
  - how maintainable are they?
- releases and release cadence: the faster your releases, the more practice the
  team has, which means its a safer and battle tested process.
- logging and metrics infrastructure
- process around on call
- Testing policy?
- Rollback?
- database optimization means and process
- architecture notes on the design of the system
- postmortems and previous post mortem learnings
- friction log for product
- documentation for processes?
