I assembled my first PC this month. It took me a full Saturday for this,
and I blame it on the case I got. I cheaped out on it, and ended up
taking a lot of time figuring things out. Here is the `build
<https://pcpartpicker.com/user/jnduli/saved/#view=CMgBZL>`_. Some of the
mistakes I made include:

- Cheaping out on the case. This made it really difficult to add
  various parts and I also ended up giving up on cable management.
- Bought too many fans. The case only supports two fans (of which it
  comes with both).

I really like the build though, and I'm using it to play games and for
some data science. I also got to find out that steam support on linux is
really great (the PC is fully linux btw).

I also did my first screen replacement this month. I own a Motorola Moto
C Plus, and its touch screen had stopped working completely. I ordered one
off ebay, and got around to replacing it. The process was
surprisingly easy. For tools, I was lucky to have everything I needed,
which was a screw driver set, tweezers and a heat gun.
