Zealot B570 Bluetooth Headset
#############################

I got the zealot b570 a couple of months ago. I have been using it
since then and it has not disappointed. Also I'm a bit clumsy so
it has been subjected to a rough time, and its still working well.

Pros
----
- Bluetooth capable
- SD card slot
- OK battery life
- I can listen to audio over mini usb and over 3.5 mm jack. I
  prefer using the mini usb option, so that's a plus.
- Good audio quality

- Really durable. I've never had a head set that lasted more than
  3 months. But this was primarily due to the 3.5 mm jack getting
  cut / broken.

Cons
----
- The headset was really tight and painful to wear. To fix it, I
  stretched it for some days and it worked well.
- The LED lights are really annoying. I wish there were an option
  to disable these.
