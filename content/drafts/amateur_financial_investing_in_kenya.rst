I've been trying to figure out the best way to grow my wealth slowly
over time. There is a lot of information out there, but it isn't
particularly organized like the reddit forum. So it's always a hit or
miss with any of these providers.

So from my experiments, these are the options I use:

1. Money Markets

   These are liquid investments where my principals are guaranteed. The
   interest is compounded per month (I think). The interest the
   providers give are annualized amounts, which change on a month per
   month basis. It's relatively safe so far I've been involved in these.

   What I use here are CMMF and CIC.

2. Government Securities
   - Treasury Bills: short term government securities that are bought at
     a discount. This means that you get the face value after maturity.
   - Treasury Bonds: Long term government securities that provide
     regular payments of interest. Ideally you'd want to buy these at
     the initial time of purchase because yield and interest are the
     same.

   The government provided TMD, a USSD based means of bidding and paying
   for the securities.

3. Stocks purchases: I hope to benefit from capital market gains, but I
   mostly invest in these as a means of diversification.

4. Fixed deposit accounts: Bank accounts that provides interest to
   amounts, so long as my money remains there for some time.

5. Mutual funds: a new findiing by standard chartered bank where I can
   invest in international funds. This is just an experiment for me but
   I think it's safe to have my money offshore.


Another idea I got was for hasving multiple buckets in each of these
types I have.

Outline:
- Money Market
- Treasury Bills/ Bonds
- Stocks purchases
- Mutual funds

Others I'm thinking of venturing into:
- Land
