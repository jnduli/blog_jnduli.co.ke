I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing, but I listen to music while
working. It helps me focus and concentrate on the task I'm working on but I
sometimes wonder if its the correct way of doing things.

A couple of alternatives I have are:

- Listen to nothing
- Listen to white noise
- Listen to classical music
- Listen to the normal music that gets me up


A disadvantage of listening to the normal music is that I get riled up, psyched
up and sometimes find myself enjoying the music rather than working.

With the others I can just focus on music and it will all be ok.
