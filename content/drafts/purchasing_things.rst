.. TODO: think about a better title

I read `this article about buying the cheapest tool
<https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/07/25/worst-tool-for-the-job/>`_ first,
then if I use it often until it breaks, then I can go ahead and buy the most
expensive one. This felt right, and I've tried to apply this to most of my
purchases. I've found that this has made me realize that I can actually live
with some of the cheap things I've bought.

I wanted to get the latest high-specc'ed thinkpad, and I'd budgeted for Ksh
150K, but chose to try out the older models first. I ended up buying a
refurbished thinkpad t440 last year for Ksh 30K and I love it. It has most of
the things I need. The only failing is playing AAA games, but this also has led
me to trying out hidden gems that I'd have ignored otherwise. If this laptop
ever breaks, I'll most likely get a similar one. I now don't see the point of
spending 5 times the amount on something that is marginally better (for my needs
that is).

.. TODO: clean these chapters out, they discuss maintenance
Another one I found out about buying the most expensive tools you can find is
that maintenance is usually a headache. This happened with our electric shower
head. When I moved in, we bought the best and most expensive head our
electrician could find. A year later, the heating element got busted, and they
couldn't find a replacement. Two weeks in with cold water, we went for the
cheaper electric one. Turns out that replacement parts should be another
consideration when doing purchases that I hadn't considered. This also happened
with my brother's laptop (an ultrabook) where he'd accidentally poured water on
the keyboard, and it needed to be replaced. We spent weeks looking for someone
that had an alternative.

Another one that happened was that we had a touch screen laptop (a dell
something), and the screen got spoiled. We haven't been able to get a
replacement for this so far. All repair shops we go to, have a price of half the
laptop price and it's irritating. I gave up on touch laptops after this
(although I didn't even use the touch functionality).


.. TODO: these came from atomic habits most likely
A common bias I get is impulse buying, anchor bias where I'll see something and
think of a reason why I would need this. Most of the time, I end up not getting
the item, but I dislike the seconds where my brain desires it. (TODO: Think of
other biases)
