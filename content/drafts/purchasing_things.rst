Cheap items
===========

I read `this article about buying the cheapest tool
<https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/07/25/worst-tool-for-the-job/>`_ first,
then if I use it until it breaks, then I can go ahead and buy the most expensive
one. This felt right, and I've tried to apply this to most of my purchases. I've
found that this has made me realize that I can actually live with some of the
cheap things I've bought.

For example, I wanted to get the latest thinkpad model, and I'd budgeted for Ksh
150K, but chose to try out the older models first. I ended up buying a
refurbished thinkpad t440 last year for Ksh 30K and I love it. It has most of
the things I need and great linux support. The only failing is playing AAA
games, but this also has led me to trying out hidden gems that I'd have ignored
otherwise. If this laptop ever breaks, I'll most likely get a similar one. I now
don't see the point of spending 5 times the amount on something that is
marginally better (for my needs that is).

I also found that sometimes getting the most expensive item can lead to
maintenance problems, especially when you need to find replacement parts. When
we moved into our place, we bought the most expensive shower head our
electrician recommended, and it lasted us a year before the heating element
needed replacement. Our electrician tried to find a replacement, but couldn't,
so we bought a new shower head. But this time we got the lower priced ones that
are more common. This also happened with my brother's laptop, where he'd
accidentally poured water on the keyboard, and it needed to be replaced. We
couldn't find one easily, and when we found one, it was costly.


.. TODO: think if this is required or if its dragging the point
.. Another one that happened was that we had a touch screen laptop (a dell
.. something), and the screen got spoiled. We haven't been able to get a
.. replacement for this so far. All repair shops we go to, have a price of half the
.. laptop price and it's irritating. I gave up on touch laptops after this
.. (although I didn't even use the touch functionality).


Impulse purchases
=================
I'm also aware of impulsive purchases that I sometimes get an urge to make. This
is usually caused by some cue, for example, I'll see a camera, and my brain will
start figuring out what I'd use it for, ignoring the fact that I rarely take
pictures even on my smart phone. I end up convincing myself that I need it, and
make the purchase (ref: atomic habits). I am more aware of this, but sometimes
even knowing about this bias, doesn't help.

I suspect local malls have been designed with this in mind, because I cannot
easily get to where I want, and have to pass through multiple shops before I get
what I want. So instead, I'll look for a shop outside the mall.

I also try and avoid places and websites with these cues. I use leetblock to
block these, and generally don't go to malls or shops if I don't have a list of
things I want to buy (and I stick to this list).


Experiences vs Things
---------------------
TODO: reread the article and jot down points
I also liked `this article on buying things not experiences
<https://write.as/harold-lee/theres-a-phrase-going-around-that-you-should-buy-experiences-not-things>`_.
Instead of looking for experiences, choosing carefully curated items to own
makes your life much more richer.
