Plan:
1. Start out with: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html and
   summarize the contents here, then do more summaries until I've got a good
   reflection of my understanding of the topic.
2. Then go with, einstellug effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect, and do the same.
3. Then go with: xy problem
4. Then lastly do: no-hello.
5. Then create a summary article with all the ideas I've collected.



Asking for help can be structured, especially for code help when stuck, enabling
both the questioner and anwswerer to have the best bang for their time.


1. Clean up the code in your branch, assuming that someone will do some sort of
   review on it. This ensures it's easy for the helper to understand what you
   were going for.
2. Add an explanation or a code snippet on how to replicate this issue. This
   way, someone can run this and replicate the problem locally.
3. Screenshots and documentation on alternatives tried, etc.


This way, the helper easily gets context with one read, is able to think of
solutions and if they want to get their hands dirty, they can replicate the same
locally.

This should happen before any syncs on the same too.
