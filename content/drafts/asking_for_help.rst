Plan:
1. Start out with: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html and
   summarize the contents here, then do more summaries until I've got a good
   reflection of my understanding of the topic.
2. Then go with, einstellug effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect, and do the same.
3. Then go with: xy problem
4. Then lastly do: no-hello.
5. Then create a summary article with all the ideas I've collected.

Summary of Smart Questions
==========================
Introduction
------------
- hackers like hard problems that are good and thought-provoking since it helps
  them develop their understaning and reveals problems that werent considered.
- despite this, they seem to answer simple questions with hostility/arrogance,
  but they are actually hostile to people that seem to be unwilling to think or
  do their homework before asking, taking time from other better questions.
- many users use software as a tool, with no interest in learning technical
  details but hackers prefer active participants in solving problems, and this
  shouldn't change.
- its ok to be ignorant, its not ok to play stupid i.e. hackers love interacting
  with equals and welcoming people into their culture, but this requires effort
  from others, and it's' not efficient for them to help those that aren't
  willing to do this.

Before you ask
--------------
Try and find an answer by yourself. This can include google search, searching
user forums, reading manuals, FAQs, experimenting or even looking at the source
code. Display the fact that you've done this in your questions (which helps show
people that you did due diligence), and if possible display what you've learned
from this. Adding the exact phrases googled also provides records on what
searches don't help, and also directs people with similar problems to the
thread. Take your time with the research, don't expect to solve a complicated
problem with a few seconds of googling, and try to understand FAQs or manuals
before approaching the experts. Prepare your question, think it through, hasty
sounding questions get hasty answers or none. Be careful not to ask the wrong
questions based on faulty assumptions, don't assume you're entitled to an answer
(since you aren't paying for support), you earn your answer by asking
substantial interesting thought provoking questions. Make it clear that you're
willing to help in the process of developing a solution e.g. would someone
providie a pointer, what's my example missing, what other sites should I search?
are better than pleas give me the exact procedur to solve my problem.

When You Ask
------------









 how to ask questions:

- 



Asking for help can be structured, especially for code help when stuck, enabling
both the questioner and anwswerer to have the best bang for their time.


1. Clean up the code in your branch, assuming that someone will do some sort of
   review on it. This ensures it's easy for the helper to understand what you
   were going for.
2. Add an explanation or a code snippet on how to replicate this issue. This
   way, someone can run this and replicate the problem locally.
3. Screenshots and documentation on alternatives tried, etc.


This way, the helper easily gets context with one read, is able to think of
solutions and if they want to get their hands dirty, they can replicate the same
locally.

This should happen before any syncs on the same too.
