A diary is a good way to write down one's thoughts and memories of
the day. 

Being a vim fan, I had to find a way to easily help me write down
my diary. This is where vim wiki comes in. It is basically a means
of writing down wikis in vim, and has an awesome diary mode.

FIrst of all install it. I use vundle as my plugin manager. So I
put this in my .vimrc:

<!--TODO include how to install-->

To use the diary mode, type \wi to enter the diary mode.

To input a new diary entry, type \w\w. It opens up a file with its
name the current date
