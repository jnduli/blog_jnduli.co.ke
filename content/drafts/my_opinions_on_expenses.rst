Cheap items
===========

I read `this article about buying the cheapest tool first
<https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/07/25/worst-tool-for-the-job/>`_, and
if I use it until it breaks, then I can go ahead and buy the most expensive one.
I've tried to apply this to my purchases, and I've realized that I can sometimes
live with the cheap things I've bought

For example, I wanted a laptop, and saved up Ksh 150K for it, but chose to try
out an older thinkpad model first. I bought a refurbished thinkpad t440 last
year for Ksh 30K and I love it. It has most of the things I need and great linux
support. The only gotcha is playing AAA games, but I've experimented more with
other games and I've found some hidden gems. If this laptop ever breaks, I'll
get a similar one. I don't see the point of spending 5 times the amount on
something that is marginally better (for my needs that is).

Sometimes getting the most expensive item can lead to maintenance problems,
especially when you need to find replacement parts. When we moved into our
place, we bought the most expensive shower head our electrician recommended, and
it worked for a year before the heating element got spoilt. Our electrician
tried to find a replacement, but couldn't, so we bought a new shower head. But
this time we got the lower priced ones that are more common. This also happened
with my brother's laptop (an ultrabook), where he'd accidentally poured water on
the keyboard, and it needed to be replaced. It took weeks to find a replacement,
and it was costly.

I now purchase cheap items mostly because:

- It provides a chance to see if I need it or not.
- The cheap item are sometimes capable of what I need.
- The cheap items are sometimes easier to repair.

.. TODO: think if this is required or if its dragging the point
.. Another one that happened was that we had a touch screen laptop (a dell
.. something), and the screen got spoiled. We haven't been able to get a
.. replacement for this so far. All repair shops we go to, have a price of half the
.. laptop price and it's irritating. I gave up on touch laptops after this
.. (although I didn't even use the touch functionality).


Impulse purchases
=================
I'm also aware of impulsive purchases that I sometimes get an urge to make. This
is usually caused by some cue, for example, I'll see a camera, and my brain will
start figuring out what I'd use it for, ignoring the fact that I rarely take
pictures even on my smart phone. I end up convincing myself that I need it, and
make the purchase (ref: atomic habits). I am more aware of this, but sometimes
even knowing about this bias, doesn't help.

I suspect local malls have been designed with this in mind, because I cannot
easily get to where I want, and have to pass through multiple shops before I get
what I want. So instead, I'll look for a shop outside the mall.

I also try and avoid places and websites with these cues. I use leetblock to
block these, and generally don't go to malls or shops if I don't have a list of
things I want to buy (and I stick to this list).


Experiences vs Things
---------------------
TODO: reread the article and jot down points
I also liked `this article on buying things not experiences
<https://write.as/harold-lee/theres-a-phrase-going-around-that-you-should-buy-experiences-not-things>`_.
Instead of looking for experiences, choosing carefully curated items to own
makes your life much more richer.
