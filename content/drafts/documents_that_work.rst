I might be making docs that need to be reviewed by more and more people, and I
want to make them easier to understand and see. So this doc details the
research I've done and the things I should add.

- be straight to the point, and avoid implementation details in the doc. If
  someone wants to know the how, they can read the code.
- take a read and edit the document before sharing it widely.
- ensure those who need access to the doc have access.
- have a tldr section before the doc starts
- provide an example that's easy to digest that explains what the doc is
  attempting to solve.
- have a deep dive section
- have links to resources people can follow along with.
- If something can be automated, automate it and drop it from the docs, pointing
  to the tool.
- prefer short succint docs to long ones
- prefer one document to having multiple ones
