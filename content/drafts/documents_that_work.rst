I might be making docs that need to be reviewed by more and more people, and I
want to make them easier to understand and see. So this doc details the
research I've done and the things I should add.

- have a tldr section before the doc starts
- provide an example that's easy to digest that explains what the doc is
  attempting to solve.
- have a deep dive section
- have links to resources people can follow along with.
