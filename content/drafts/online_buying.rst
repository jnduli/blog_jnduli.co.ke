From ebay and aliexpress, just use your postal address in Kenya.
They will be delivered there.

For purchases from US, you can use Kentex Cargo.
For purchases from Dubai, China, UK, you can use Shardi Express.

The good thing with Kentex and Shardi is that they bill you per
weight of good, not per value of the good.

When buying from amazon, the prices given are less tax, so
consider that too.
