I own a thinkpad t440 that isn't powerful by any standard:

.. code-block:: bash

    ╰─$ sudo dmidecode --string system-family
    ThinkPad T440
    ╰─$ sudo dmidecode --string processor-version
    Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4200U CPU @ 1.60GHz


I can actually do some gaming on this using steam, and it's been really
enjoyable. The catch is to find games that will work ok on my rig, which is
mostly a hit or a miss. So far these are the ones that I have:

+ children of moria https://store.steampowered.com/app/330020/Children_of_Morta/
+ slay the spire https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/

TODO: look for more games I can play on this laptop.

Only problem is that I can't multitask while playing these games. I have to
close them off whenever I want to do anything else.
