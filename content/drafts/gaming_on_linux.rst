My laptop is average at best:

.. code-block:: bash

    ╰─$ sudo dmidecode --string system-family
    ThinkPad T440
    ╰─$ sudo dmidecode --string processor-version
    Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4200U CPU @ 1.60GHz
    ╰─$ lspci | grep -i vga
    00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)


But I can game on this using steam, and it's been enjoyable. The catch is to
find games that work ok on my rig, which if I avoid AAA titles are most of the
games. I've tried these:

+ children of moria https://store.steampowered.com/app/330020/Children_of_Morta/
+ slay the spire https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/
+ transistor



TODO: look for more games I can play on this laptop.

Only problem is that I can't multitask while playing these games. I have to
close them off whenever I want to do anything else.
