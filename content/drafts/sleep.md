Title: Sleep

I try to sleep at 9 and wake up at 4 every day. That gives me 7 hours of sleep
but this sometimes doesnt work out too well and I have to counter this.

Commong occurrences are:
- I dont feel sleepy so I go to bed and lay awake for hours
- I find myself on my phone and scroll the hours away
- some event that happened.

Most of the time, I'll then wake up tired when I dont sleep early and I wonder
what impact this has on my day
