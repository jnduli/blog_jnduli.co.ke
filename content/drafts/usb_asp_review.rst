I recently got some usb asps to use in programming my avrs. I've
never used this, so it was a bit difficult to set up. 

First I got it with the 10 pin connector, so I went online and
found its schematic.

I then connected it to the attiny13 and burned the firmware into
it. Note that the image is where it plugs into, so one connects
wires to it as though a mirror image.

I also burned code into the atmega8 and it too worked.

For its price, this is a cheap and awesome product to help one
play around with avrs.
