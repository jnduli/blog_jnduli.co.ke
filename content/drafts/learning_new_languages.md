Summary: TODO

A few years back, I went through Learn You a Haskell and got a rudimentary
understanding of functional programming, but then I didn't do anything much with
this new knowledge, and after a few years, I barely remembered any of it. This
has happened with vuejs, golang and many more. This seems like time wasted but I
think/hope some of it stuck with me through principles I unconsciously apply to
my code.

I don't want this to happen again though, so a couple of things I'm doing while
going through the haskell book again is:

- ankifying concepts I need to remember. This means I'll be able to test my
  knowledge regularly when I do anki.
- regular practice on katas using haskell, using the codewars website. I do the
  fundamentals problems only since my goal is to keep fresh my knowledge of the
  language.
- make a simple project in my dotfiles repo that will implement a lot of what I
  learn about haskell, and have a TODO on how to build, install and run the
  project.
