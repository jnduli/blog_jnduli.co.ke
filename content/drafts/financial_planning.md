I want to pay my day to day bills from my passive income. I'll be a step closer
to financial freedom once then.

I've got some foundation around this like:

- I track my expenses with ledger-cli, meaning I have some measure of my average
  expenses.
- I track my income using ledger-cli, meaning I know how much I earn regularly.
  This is tricky because they don't pay out at a regular cadence, so I instead
  do an average of income per the last year.
- I have a rough idea of the interest I earn in some of my savings.

This means I have a good idea of how far I am from achieving my goal. I can also
see how log I can live with my savings in case I lose my job.

AIs:
- provide an example of how I use ledger-cli to track my expenses and savings
- provide an example of how I calculate my emergency funds lasting in case I
  lose my job.
- investigate how to embed vim in this page and create a simple calculator for
  this
