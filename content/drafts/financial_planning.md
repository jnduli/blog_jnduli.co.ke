I'm big on financial freedom and I've been trying to achieve this.


What do I mean by financial freedom:

Its being able to pay my day to day bills from my passive income. Once I'm able
to do this, I think I'm financially free.

How do I work to achieve this?

- I track my expenses with ledger. This means I can always get my average
  expenses per month. I usually limit this to the last 12 months.
- I have my liquid savings. This gives me an idea for how long I can live the
  same life in case I lose my main source of income.
- I have my income earning avenues and a rough idea for how much it earns, which
  enables me to know how long into the future this can last me.
