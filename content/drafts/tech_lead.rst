I became a tech lead and I've been struggling with a lot since this
happenened. Some of the challenges are:

- It seems like I have way too much to do.
- I need to support team members which is more work that I thought it
  would be.
- I have to plan for the future and this isn't as clear as I thought
  it'd be.
- I need to support decisions that I make with evidence or something.
- I need to learn a whole host of skills that I've ignored for a while.

It's overwhelming and I'm trying to figure things out and research how
to do this and be better efficient. I think this is because I've
focussed a lot of time in improving my workflow geared to code
contributions and I don't know much about how to effectively work with a
team beyond explaining what challenges I have, how I'm working on them
and how I should proceed.

I now have to be aware of other's challenges, try to understand these
and get a feel of where they're coming from and what solutions they're
making.

Some of the things I've done to help with this is:
- I've scheduled a daily task in my daily management tool (tasklite add
  link) to ensure I unblock team members, do PR reviews and add relevant
  comments to tickets. This helps me be in the loop for what is
  happening within the team, though I'm still unsure of how this works
  and helps.
- I'm looking for reads on how to better my soft skills and how to
  better my project management skills.
- I'm more aware of the limited time I have so I try to optimize my day
  around the most important thing to do. This is super hard at the
  moment though.

TODO: do a lot of research on tips to help with this and how I can
implement this.

- Output is measured differently than I'm used to:
  what made me a good IC is not necessarily the same as what will make
  me a good tech lead. After a few months I feel I'm not as productive
  as I used to be since as an IC my sense of accomplishment came purely
  from technical work like writing code, refactoring, optimizing
  features. As a tech lead, I have to carve out a technical direction of
  my team. Responsibilities now include having an overview of the entire
  system the team is building, establishing technical vision and driving
  alignment. My output depends on how my team can deliver too.
- Aligning priorities is now part of my job. This means helping my team
  focus on what's most important and impactful, and making sure the
  team's efforts are all in sync with one another. I have to constantly
  balance resources, scope and time. Scope is the work to be done,
  resources includes budget, team members, etc. and times are the
  deadlines and how long I have to deliver.
- How I communicate matters more. Rather than simply making information
  available for people, I have to think carefully about what and how I
  communicate to people in order to achieve the desired outcome. Avoid
  the curse of knowledge, where I find it difficult to remember what it
  feels like to be a novice.
- Avoid premature fixes: learn to wait for things to unfold in order to
  have a clearer picture of what's going on before implementing a fix.
  Instead of rushing in to create tons of processes right away, wait for
  the problems to surface due to a lack of process that fixes them,
  which means we'll be able to craft a more appropriate solution and
  easily get team buy-in.
- Learn how to manage projects: I now have an obligation to users and
  stakeholders to ensure work gets done. I need to identify and tackle
  non-engineering bottlenecks that prevent work being delivered on time
  or block  team's progress. I need to plan and break tasks down, and
  inform stakeholders outside team on what is going on in engineering,
  and inform my team what's going on in other teams.
