Introduction
------------

Subject (I AM): self concepts we're attached to and can't reflect on or
objectively look at e.g. personality traits, assumptions about how the world
works, behaviours, emotions, etc.

Object (I HAVE): self concepts we can detach ourselves from, that we can look
at, reflect upon, engage, control and connect to something else.

Subject-object shift happens when something moves from Subject (where it's
controlling us) to Object (where we can control it) e.g. in religion, when
younger, it's subject (I am catholic) but when we're older it becomes more
objective (I'm a human with beliefs and I can step back, reflect and decide what
to believe)

Stage 2 - The Imperial Mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subject: IS needs, interests, desires
Object: HAS impulses, feelings and perceptions.

Relationships are transactional. They view people as a means to get something.
They care about how others perceive them because this may have concrete
consequences for them e.g. they don't lie to each other because of fear of the
consequences of retaliation, not because they value honesty and transparency in
a relationship.

They follow along with rules, values etc. because of external rewards and
punishments, not because they truly believe them e.g. they won't cheat because
they're scared of the consequences, not because it goes against their personal
values.

Stage 3: The Socialized Mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subject: IS interpersonal relationships, mutuality
Object: HAS needs, interests, desires

External sources shape our sense of self and understanding the world. Most
important are the ideas, norms, beliefs of the people around us (family,
society, culture).

- we get our thoughts, beliefs, morals from external sources.
- we take too much personal responsibility for how other people experience us,
  thus spend too much time trying to avoid hurting other's feelings.
- we look for external validation to derive our sense of self e.g. an executive
  doesn't know if a meeting was successful until colleagues tell her.
- we don't have an independent, strong sense of self. If there's a conflict
  between ideologies/people, we have a hard time answering 'What do I want?'
  because we're too focused on others expectations or societal roles.
- we no longer view other people as a means to an end, and internalize their
  perspectives and care about their opinions of us e.g. I care that you're angry
  with me because I care about you and our relationship, not just because you
  won't invite me to your party.

In regards to cheating:

- stage 2: worried about getting caught and consequences
- stage 3: feel guilty and a disturbing dissonance because cheating is wrong and
  goes against their belief system and values.

Stage 4: The Self Authoring Mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subject: IS self-authorship, identity, ideology
Object: HAS relationships, mutuality

We define who we are, not other people/relationships/environment. 

- We can question expectations and values, take stands, set limits and solve
  problems with independent frames of mind.
- We can explore other thoughts and feelings, creating our own sense of
  authority or voice.
- We can take responsibility for our own inner states and emotions e.g. I feel
  angry because I interpret what you did as a violation of my important values,
  and if I interpreted you actions differently I might feel sad instead.
- We generate our understanding of the world and are not unduly shaped by the
  context in which we find ourselves.
- We realize that we're always changing, that who we are is something that we
  can still negotiate.

Stage 5: The Interconnected Mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subject: IS
Object: HAS self authorship, identity and ideology.

One's sense of self is not tied to particular identities or roles, but is
constantly created through the exploration of one's identities and roles and
further honed through interactions with others.

- We are both self-authoring and willing to work with the authority of others.
  We can question authority, and also question ourselves.
- We are no longer held prisoner by our own identity. We see complexities of
  life, can expand who we are and be open to other possibilities i.e.
  reinventing our identity.
- We can hold multiple thoughts and ideologies at once. We can understand things
  from many different perspectives.


Getting to Stage 4, self-authorship
-----------------------------------
Ref: https://medium.com/@NataliMorad/part-2-how-to-be-an-adult-kegans-theory-of-adult-development-ddf057b4517b

Self-authorship: defining and reshaping what I believe, my sense of self and my
relations with others, rather than uncritically accepting them from others.

How/what do I know? (Beliefs) - generating and coordinating one's own beliefs,
values and internal loyalties.
Who am I? (Intra-personal) - I am concerned with personal integrity, aligning
actions with values
How do I want to construct relationships with others? (Inter-personal) - thinking
about feelings and relationships instead of being subject to them.

Key is to view yourself as object, and evaluate, analyze and understand it.

*How to get there*
I cultivate an internal voice by practising curiosity, critical reflection and
openness. I become curious about myself, stop taking myself for granted or think
that I've got myself all figured out.

Ask:

**What do I think?**
We repeat what we hear/experience from others without taking time to analyze our
thoughts. So we don't know what we believe, think and value, and conversations
rarely get deep enough to challenge us to think about what we think e.g. what do
I think about 'love means never having to say you are sorry.' What does this
mean to me? Do I agree/disagree and why? State my opinion in a full sentence.

Practice this throughout the day, pay attention to what I see and hear around
me, stop for a second and be curious about what I think and ask: what do I
actually think about it and why? I state my thoughts in a coherent sentence.
Other questions can be: "What do I think a relationship should look like and
why?", "How do I know that someone is a good friend?", "What's my policy on
honesty and why?"

**What do I want?**
I define what I want and clearly tell these to those I care about.

We spend too much time managing and reacting to others wants and not enought
time on what we want, thus the habit of doing X because we feel guilty/bad
instead of because they align with who I want to be.

Practice operating from the pace of what do I want vs what do other people want
from me e.g. Jane was in camp and everyone was expected to help, but she felt
guilty for note helping out enough for the first 2 days and worried about how
others saw her. She started helping out more because of the guilt but these
feeling persisted. A smaller mental shift would have been to as 'what do I
want?' and to contribute/bail on responsibilities.

We want clarity, so be very specific with your wants. Avoid big/vague words like
'I want to care more' or 'I want more responsibility' because this results in
misunderstandings, so first figure out what you want e.g. I want you to check in
with me once a day, I want you to take the lead on Project X. The cleared the
want the easier for me/others to make decisions.

**What are my motivations**
There are higher motivations (good reasons that come from our higher selves, the
person we want to be/imagine ourselves as) and lower motivations (real reasons
that come from our lower selves driven by guilt, desire, ego, uncertainty) e.g.
I'll criticize a workmate because I want to help them improve their performance
(higher reason) but I also want to make them feel bad/make myself feel better
(lower motivation).

Which motivation is driving me more and why? Which ones do I want to drive me
more and why? What kind of person do I want to be?

It's impossible to get rid of lower motivations but we can manage them (instead
of letting them control me). We take the lower motivations and make them object,
something to explore, analyze and manage, to get to know them and be curious
about them.

We start to practice being open to myself as I really am.

*Building a self-authored system - honoring internal commitments*
I've identified what I think, believe and want, and why. I need to live
according to this system and honor my internal commitments.

How? I make decisions aligned with my wants and values. Every decision
I make is a change to get closer to what I want, but there's a gap between what
we say we value and how we actually behave e.g. in dating, people say they want
a serious committed relationship but will date people that are unavailable.

It takes a lot of work to align our actions with our values, and its easier to
follow the path of least resistance (but this is where I am or it heads in the
wrong direction).

Practice by making small decisions that align with my values. The more I do it,
the more confident I become.


Getting to Stage 5: InterConnected Mind
---------------------------------------
In stage 5, one's sense of self isn't tied to particular identities or roles,
but is constantly created through the exploration of one's identities and roles
and further honed through interactions with others.

Characteristics are:

- Nothing is black or white: life, people, emotions, rlshps are complicated and
  always changing, constantly moving along a spectrum, never just one way or
  another e.g. I am not impatient, I'm patient in certain situations and
  impatient in others.
- We can question authority and ourselves
- We embrace paradox

Creating Fertile Space for Development:

- understanding our self, constant awareness and humility: we're aware of what
  we're thinking/feeling and how we're behaving, and are humble. We are in
  "learning mode" and accept that the problems we keep coming up against aren't
  about the world but about us. We realize we're inadequate and want more out of
  our lives and our relationships and are willing to do the work.
- Sharing our self: honest, real conversations with people we trust:
    - psychological and emotional safety: have at least one source you feel safe
      and seen around to express what you're thinking/feeling without judgement
      (not opinions about a movie but hard, painful, uncomfortable thoughts and
      feelings). This is important because we need to be vulnerable and own our
      stories to grow, which makes us vulnerable, hence the support enables us
      to push our comfort zones and question long held thoughts and beliefs.
    - Rational discourse: having an active dialogue with others to better
      understand the meaning of our experience, key being 'active', so its not
      stating your thoughts, but engaging in an exploration of why you think
      what you do.
- Transcending our self: experiment with self-transcendent experiences. Most of
  stage 5 people have dabbled in self-transcendent experiences beginning with
  psychedelics, then meditation, martial arts and other state-shifting practices
  become a central part of their lives. A Self Transcendent Experience (STE) is
  one where you're lifted above day-to-day concerns, sense of self fades away
  and you fell connected to something bigger.
