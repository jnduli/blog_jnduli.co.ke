Self-authorship: defining and reshaping what you believe, your sense of self and
you relationships with others, rather than uncritically accepting them from
others.

How/what do I know? (Beliefs) - generating and coordinating one's own beliefs,
values and internal loyalties.
Who am I? (Intrapersonal) - being concerned with personal integrity, aligning
actions with values
How do I want to construct relationships with others? (Interpersonal) - thinking
about feelings and relationships instead of being subject to them.

Key is to view yourself as object, something that can be evaluated, analyzed and
understood.

*How to get there*
cultivating the internal voice: we practise curiosity, critical reflection and
openness. We become curious about ourselves, and stop taking ourselves for
granted or thinking that we've got ourselves all figured out

To practice curiosity, ask yourself:
- what do I think? Most of us don't really know what we believe, think and
  value, but rather repeat what we hear or experience from parents, friends,
  community, etc without taking time to analyze our thoughts. Conversations
  rarely get deep enough to challenge us to think about what we think.
  For example: what do you think about the phrase "love means never having to
  say you're sorry." We've all heard this before but what does it mean to me? Do
  I agree/disagree and why? State my opinion in a full sentence.
  Practice this throughout the day, pay attention to what I see and hear around
  me, stop for a second and be curious about what I think and ask: what do I
  actually think about this and why? Key is to state my thoughts in a coherent
  sentence. Other questions can be: "What do I think a relationship should look
  like and why?", "How do I know that someone is a good friend?", "What's my
  policy on honest and why?"

TODO: Question 2, what do I want?
