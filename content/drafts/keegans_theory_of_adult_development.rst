Part 1

Subject (I AM): self concepts we're attached to and thus can't reflect on or take
an objective look at. Can include personality traits, assumptions about how the
world works, behaviours, emotions, etc.

Object (I HAVE): self concepts we can detach ourselves from, that we can look
at, reflect upon, engage, control and connect to something else.

Subject-object shift happens when something moves from Subject (where it's
controlling us) to Object (where we can control it).

e.g. in religion, when younger, it's subjection (I am catholic) but when we're
older it becomes more objective (I'm a human with beliefs who can step back and
reflect on and decide what to believe in)

Stage 2 - The Imperial Mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subject: IS needs, interests, desires
Object: HAS impulses, feelings and perceptions.

Relationships are transactional. They view people as a means to get their own
needs met. They care about how others perceive them, but only becausue this may
have concrete consequences for them e.g. they don't lie to each other because of
fear of the consequences of retaliation, not because they value honesty and
transparency in a relationship.

They follow along with rules, philosophies etc. because of external rewards and
punishments, not because they truly believe them e.g. they won't cheat because
they're scared of the consequences, not because it goes against their personal
values.

Stage 3: The Socialized Mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subject: IS interpersonal relationships, mutuality
Object: HAS needs, interests, desires

External sources shape our sense of self and understanding the world. The most
important things are the ideas, norms, beliefs of the people around us (family,
society, culture).

- we get our thoughts, beliefs, morals from external sources.
- we take too much personal responsibility for how other people experience us,
  thus spend too much time trying to avoid hurting other's feelings.
- we look for external validation to derive our sense of self e.g. an executive
  doesn't know if a particular meeting was successful until colleagues tell her
  so.
- we don't have an independent, strong sense of self. If there's a conflict
  between ideologies, people, we have a hard time answering 'What do I want?'
  because we're too busy focused on others expectations or societal roles.
- we no longer view other people as a means to an end, and internalize others
  perspectives and care about their opinions of use e.g. I care that you're
  angry with me because I care about you and our relationship, not just because
  you won't invite me to your party.

In regards to cheating:
- stage 2: worried about getting caught and consequences
- stage 3: feel guilty and a disturbing dissonance because cheating is wrong and
  goes against their belief system and values.

Stage 4: The Self Authoring Mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subject: IS self-authorship, identity, ideology
Object: HAS relationships, mutuality

We can define who we are, and not be defined by other people, our relationships
or the environment. We can not distinguish the opinions of others from our own
opinions to formulate our own sense of judgement.

- We can question expectations and values, take stands, set limits and solve
  problems with independent frames of mind.
- We can explore other thoughts and feelings, creating our own sense of
  authority or voice.
- We can take responsibility for our own inner states and emotions e.g. I feel
  angry because I interpret what you did as a violation of important values of
  mine, and if I interpreted you actions differently I might feel sad instead.
- We generate our understanding of the world and are not unduly shaped by the
  context in which we find ourselves.
- We realize that we're always changing, that who we are is something that we
  can still negotiate.

Stage 5: The Interconnected Mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subject: IS
Object: HAS self authorship, identity and ideology.

One's sense of self is not tied to particular identities or roles, but is
constantly created through the exploration of one's identities and roles and
further honed through interactions with others.

- We are both self-authoring and willing to work with the authority of others.
  We can question authority, and also question ourselves.
- We are no longer held prisoner by our own identity. We see complexities of
  life, can expand who we are and be open to other possibilities i.e.
  reinventing our identity.
- We can hold multiple thoughts and ideologies at once. We can understand things
  from many different perspectives.

Self-authorship: defining and reshaping what you believe, your sense of self and
you relationships with others, rather than uncritically accepting them from
others.

How/what do I know? (Beliefs) - generating and coordinating one's own beliefs,
values and internal loyalties.
Who am I? (Intrapersonal) - being concerned with personal integrity, aligning
actions with values
How do I want to construct relationships with others? (Interpersonal) - thinking
about feelings and relationships instead of being subject to them.

Key is to view yourself as object, something that can be evaluated, analyzed and
understood.

*How to get there*
cultivating the internal voice: we practise curiosity, critical reflection and
openness. We become curious about ourselves, and stop taking ourselves for
granted or thinking that we've got ourselves all figured out

To practice curiosity, ask yourself:
- what do I think? Most of us don't really know what we believe, think and
  value, but rather repeat what we hear or experience from parents, friends,
  community, etc without taking time to analyze our thoughts. Conversations
  rarely get deep enough to challenge us to think about what we think.
  For example: what do you think about the phrase "love means never having to
  say you're sorry." We've all heard this before but what does it mean to me? Do
  I agree/disagree and why? State my opinion in a full sentence.
  Practice this throughout the day, pay attention to what I see and hear around
  me, stop for a second and be curious about what I think and ask: what do I
  actually think about this and why? Key is to state my thoughts in a coherent
  sentence. Other questions can be: "What do I think a relationship should look
  like and why?", "How do I know that someone is a good friend?", "What's my
  policy on honest and why?"

Question 2, what do I want? Defining what we want and clearly
communicating those wants to those we care about. We spend too much time
managing and reacting to others' wants and not enough on clarifying what we
want, thus we have the habit of doing things because we feel guilty of bad
instead of doing them because they align with the person we want to be. We need
to practice *operating from the pace of what do I want vs what do other people
want from me* e.g. author was in camp where everyone was expected to help out,
and for first two days they felt guilty for not helping out enough and started
worrying about how others saw them, hence they started helping uut more (because
they felt guilty and didn't want the judgement) but these feelings persisted, a
smaller better shift could have been to ask 'what do I want?', to be a
contributing memeber or to bail on my responsibilities. We're after clarity, so
be very specific with your wants. Using big/vague words like 'I want to care
more' or 'I want more responsibility' causes conflict and misunderstandings, so
do the work and first figure out what you want e.g. I want you to check in with
me once a day, I want you to take the lead on Project X, etc. The clearer the
wants, the easier it is for me and others to make decisions.

Question 3: What are my motivations? There are higher motivations (good reasons
that come from our higher selves, the person we want to be or imagine ourselves
to be) and lower motivations (real reasons that come from our lower selves
driven by guilt, desire, ego, uncertainty) e.g. I'll criticize a colleagure
because I want to help them improve their performance (higher reason) but I may
also want to make them feel bad or make myself feel better (lower motivation).
We all have these motivations, the main question is which are driving me more
and why? and which ones do I want to drive me more and why? What kind of person
do I want to be? Its impossible to get rid of the lower motivations, but we can
manage them (instead of letting them control me). We take these lower
motivations and make them object, something we can explore analyze and manage,
to get to know them and be curious about them. We start to practice openness and
being open to myself as I really am.


## Building a self-authored system - honoring internal commitments
I've identified what I think, believe and want, and why. I need to live
according to this system, thus I honor my internal commitments. How? I make
decisions that are aligned with my wants and values. Every decision I make is a
change to get closer to what I want, but there's a gap between what we say we
value and how we actually behave e.g. in dating, people say they want a serious
committed relationship but will date people that are unavailable.

It takes a lot of work to align our actions with our values, and its easier to
follow the path of least resistance (but this is where I am or it heads in the
wrong direction).

So practice by making small decisions that align with my values.

When we honor our internal commitments, we gain confidence. The more I do it,
the more confident I become.

Part 3
------
In stage 5, one's sense of self isn't tied to particular identities or roles,
but is constantly created through the exploration of one's identities and roles
and further honed through interactin with others.

Xtics of stage 5:
- Nothing is black or white: life, people, emotions, rlshps are complicated and
  always changing. They're constantly moving along a spectrum, never just one
  way or anther (i.e. I am not impatient, I'm patient in certain situations and
  impatient in others).
- We can question authority and ourselves
- We embrace paradox

Creating Fertile Space for Development:
- understanding our self, constant awareness and humility: be aware of what
  we're thinking and feeling and how we're behaving, and to practice humility.
  This means putting ourselves in "learning mode" and accept the problems we
  keep coming up against are nout about the world but about us. We realize we're
  inadequate and want more out of our lives and our relationships and are
  willing to do the work.
- Sharing our self: honest, real conversations with people we trust
