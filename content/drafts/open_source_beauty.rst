Look for quote on auditing things.

I really like using some software, but limitations of the tool and extensibility
are a problem I've occassionally found. I'd like to do something that the tool
doesn't support, but that seems easy to implement, but I'm pretty sure it isn't
in the priority list of the vendors. That's where open source bears its fangs. I
can always fork the project and add the features I want to the tool.

I've done this with the following:

- T-UI: added timer util that can help me easily set up timers from the
  launcher. I also got to see how an android project is organized and I'm going
  to put in more effort into the tool.
- Tasklite: a haskell made task management tool that I use daily. I've added up
  features for more advanced queries that I like on my fork. I also look through
  the code to understand how a haskell project is organized and I'm able to do
  custom things I want because of this understanding.

TODO: think of others that I have or that I'm thinking of doing the same to.
TODO: I'll publish this out once I've done the same on about 5 projects.
