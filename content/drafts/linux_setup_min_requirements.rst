I set up my laptop again but realized I don't have an easy way of getting up and
ready. I've tried something `in my install script here
<https://github.com/jnduli/dotfiles/blob/3c850b2f6daec024ad3c57b4ea60dc884614f74f/install.sh#L34>`_
but that's limited to archlinux and doesn't have everything I need to work.

As I work on some long term alternative e.g. guix package manager, I'll create a
doc that contains everything I think I need and update this as I change. I'll
also work on a script that tells me what I have and what I don't.
