Kizuri chajiuza, kibaya chajitembeza loosely translates to 'the good sells
itself, while the bad walks around`. This implies that good things will always
attracts users and buyers, whereas bad things will have to do a lot of marketing
and advertising to get to the market.

I think this is true partially, but is more nuanced than just good and bad. The
problem is that the bad will spend a lot of time marketting itself, such that
even if you have a good product, you wont have any attention to your product. It
will be really difficult to get headspace on this and your product might die
before you even reach profitability.

Another use case here is in job searching. A naive approach would be that since
I'm good at my job, I don't need to network and advertise myself, but the
problem is that if I don't do that no one will know about me and how capable I
am. I'll just be hoping on the good words of my co-workers and previous
employees, which is limiting myself to this small space.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we need to market ourselves somehow, and
build some network actively, such that it ends up helping ourselves or our
products in worse case scenarios.
