`Kizuri chajiuza, kibaya chajitembeza` is a swahili proverb that translates to
`the good sells itself, whereas the bad walks around`. This means that something
good will attract people e.g. product to customers, plan to investors, and while
this may be true sometimes, I think its false in most situations.

One problem is that the bad spends a lot of time and money in marketing and not
building the product. It ends up having the public's attention, and you won't
get a chance to get the customers you want with your superior product.

I've naively held this belief, even if I didn't consciously know of it. Its held
various forms in my life like:

- I'll be so good that employers will come chasing me for a job.
- I'll write the best code that ...
- I'll do anonymous donations ....
- I don't need a network because my track record speaks for itself


I'm not saying that we don't put in the effort to improve ourselves, rather that
we should also aim to improve our selling skills. I'm far off from this but
trying to become better at it.

Another use case here is in job searching. A naive approach would be that since
I'm good at my job, I don't need to network and advertise myself, but the
problem is that if I don't do that no one will know about me and how capable I
am. I'll just be hoping on the good words of my co-workers and previous
employees, which is limiting myself to this small space.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we need to market ourselves somehow, and
build some network actively, such that it ends up helping ourselves or our
products in worse case scenarios.
