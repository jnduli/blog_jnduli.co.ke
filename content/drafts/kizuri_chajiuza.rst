`Kizuri chajiuza, kibaya chajitembeza` is a swahili proverb that translates to
`the good sells itself, whereas the bad walks around`. This means that something
good will attract people e.g. product to customers, plan to investors, and while
this may be true sometimes, I think its false in most situations.

One problem is that the bad spends a lot of time and money in marketing and not
building the product. It ends up having the public's attention, and you won't
get a chance to get the customers you want with your superior product.

I've naively held this belief, even if I didn't consciously know of it. Its held
various forms in my life like:

- I'll be so good that employers will come chasing me for a job.
- I'll write the best code that ...
- I'll do anonymous donations ....
- I don't need a network because my track record speaks for itself


I'm not saying that we don't put in the effort to improve ourselves, rather that
we should also aim to improve our selling skills. I'm far off from this but
trying to become better at it.

I'm saying we need to take an active, and not passive approach to selling
ourselves.
