My phone almost died and I realized I don't have an easy way to set up my phone
from scratch. I figured I'd write down the software I need on an android phone
and the plan for how to restore things back to normal if this ever happens
again.

The play store will by default install most of these, meaning I don't have to do
much. The problem is the custom apps I've side-loaded.

Here are the apps I need:

- tui (terminal launcher my custom fork)
- bank apps (sc mobile)
- new pipe (youtube without ads and tracking)
- firefox and kiwi
- authenticator (transfer from old phone)
- mail apps (yahoo, gmail, fastmail)
- ankidroid
- antennapod
- CIC assets
- daily dozen
- discord
- F-Droid
- Family Link
- FastMail
- Firefox
- Goodreads
- Medito
- MySafaricom
- Spotify
- Strava
- Whatsapp
- Zepp
