Rough Draft Without Research
============================

I complain and make myself angry a lot. I'll have an internal dialogue that will
loop over the same points, making me feel worse and worse. I'll sometimes try to
write down why I'm so angry or anxious, and realize that it was a simple
problem, and thought-loop inertial stopped me from realizing this.

This is `Chatter`, where our brain gets stuck in negative thought loops and can
be thoughts about a past event e.g. something someone told me (rumination) or
about the future e.g. what will happen (worry).

I subconsciously like this feeling and sometimes find my brain looking for
something to complain or be angry about. I'll also try to find someone to
validate my feelings, which ends up with a one sided talk about my problems and
complaints. I won't notice solutions the other person suggests since I'm too
fixated on my problems. It's only later on, when I reflect on what they said
that I figure things out.

What seems to work for me is cycling. When I reach some point of exhaustion, I
stop thinking about things and my mind calms down for the rest of the ride.


TODO: edit
I've found some ways to stop this that include:
Some ways suggested in the nautilus article are to change the perspective of
thought by:

- distanced self talk, where instead of referring to me in my thoughts I use my
  name or other pronouns like you, he, she.
- taking nature walks, which draw attention to nature, promoting a sense of awe,
  making my concerns seem smaller.
- doing a physical task like tidying up.

TODO: clean up

Another one I've seen is `support-complaining` where I give a complaint and the
other person one-ups my complaint. I then double down on my complaint of come up
with an even worse one, and the other does  the same. We end up in this cycle
until we are all angry and worked up, but haven't got a solution which is a
waste of time.


Research
--------

Chatter occurs when we have negative thought loops, being stuck on the same
thing. It involves rumination (looping about the past) or worry (about the
future) and we don't come up with a concrete solution to the problem. For
example, we might get fixated on a two minute conversation from some days ago,
replaying it over and over in our heads, without coming up with a solution.

We chatter when we experience negative emotions, try to analyze the feelings and
zoom narrowly on the experience, forgetting there are other ways to think about
it. This gets us stuck in a loop where we rehash what we felt and are feeling.

Chatter affects our performance, social relationships (we only talk about our
problems, on and on, or lash at others when we have negative emotions), and
stresses us.

- meditation
- practice mindfulness (pay attention to the present on purpose
  non-judgementally)
- Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), where a person is trained to recognize a
  negative thought process they fall on, and then consciously create a new
  though (that's' based more on reality) to replace it.
  TODO: Research  Mindfullness based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
- Color, count, recite, run: subtle ways to focus our minds on something that
  isn't our rambling thoughts.
- Talk to an actual person or write. Talking in your head is abstract, unordered
  thoughts and worries, but verbalizing these helps generate meaning from the
  thoughts. 
- Practice acceptance (Acceptance and Commitment Theory). You try to acccept the
  current reality as is, however lousy, instead of trying to change it (TODO:
  research how to do this). Self-compassion is treating yourself with kindness
  and responding to anxiety with gentle understanding and soothing, and changes
  the internal dialogue to 'it's hard to feel this way but you can get through
  this' and encourages people not to blame themselves for anxiety.
- Cognitive defusion: take a thought and change the function of how it impacts
  me e.g. if I loop through 'life is meaningless', reframe it as 'I'm having a
  thought that life is meaningless' and repeat it as the second sentence, taking
  the negative punch out of hearing it. You can try positive direction/positive
  affect where you re-word your negative thoughts like instead of thinking 'I
  cant do this` or 'Ill never be able to make this goal happen`, twist this into
  a positve way by saying `Of course I can be successful' or 'I'm going to
  definitely make this happen' to cheer me on, stimulating goal directed
  behavior.
