I have a bad habit of complaining and enraging myself. This happens in my
internal dialogue and if I forget to stop it, grows in intensity and worsens
until I end up angry and enraged over something that's small. Sometimes I'll
write down why I'm angry and realize that this was a simple problem that has a
simple solution, and my brain was just hanging on to the feeling of being
enraged.


I think I like this feeling and that's why my brain tries to support it and make
it grow and contain this feelings. It feels good to be enraged.


Another facet of this is that it also feels good when someone validates my
anger/complaints. This leads to having talks where I'm just complaining. The
other party more often than not will try to help, but I'm looking for the
validation so much that I miss this. It's only later on when I reflect on this
that I realize that I'd already been given a great solution.


So how do I get out of this habit? I want to create a system where if I have a
complaint running in my brain I also try to come up with a solution. This keeps
me grounded and prvents my thoughts spiralling out of control. This is easier
said than done though, and I'll try and see if this can pan out well.


Another one I've seen is `support-complaining` where I give a complaint and the
other person one-ups my complaint. I then double down on my complaint of come up
with an even worse one, and the other does  the same. We end up in this cycle
until we are all angry and worked up, but haven't got a solution which is a
waste of time.
