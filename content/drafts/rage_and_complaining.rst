Rough Draft Without Research
============================

I complain and make myself angry a lot. I'll have an internal dialogue that will
loop over the same points, making me feel worse and worse. I'll sometimes try to
write down why I'm so angry or anxious, and realize that it was a simple
problem, and thought-loop inertial stopped me from realizing this.

This is `Chatter`, where our brain gets stuck in negative thought loops and can
be thoughts about a past event e.g. something someone told me (rumination) or
about the future e.g. what will happen (worry).

I subconsciously like this feeling and sometimes find my brain looking for
something to complain or be angry about. I'll also try to find someone to
validate my feelings, which ends up with a one sided talk about my problems and
complaints. I won't notice solutions the other person suggests since I'm too
fixated on my problems. It's only later on, when I reflect on what they said
that I figure things out.


TODO: edit

So how do I get out of this habit? I want to create a system where if I have a
complaint running in my brain I also try to come up with a solution. This keeps
me grounded and prvents my thoughts spiralling out of control. This is easier
said than done though, and I'll try and see if this can pan out well.


Another one I've seen is `support-complaining` where I give a complaint and the
other person one-ups my complaint. I then double down on my complaint of come up
with an even worse one, and the other does  the same. We end up in this cycle
until we are all angry and worked up, but haven't got a solution which is a
waste of time.

Chatter occurs when we have negative thought loops, being stuck on the same
thing. It involves rumination (looping about the past) or worry (about the
future) and we don't come up with a concrete solution to the problem. For
example, we might get fixated on a two minute conversation from some days ago,
replaying it over and over in our heads, without coming up with a solution.

We chatter when we experience negative emotions, try to analyze the feelings and
zoom narrowly on the experience, forgetting there are other ways to think about
it. This gets us stuck in a loop where we rehash what we felt and are feeling.

Chatter affects our performance, social relationships (we only talk about our
problems, on and on, or lash at others when we have negative emotions), and
stresses us.

How do we quiet chatter:
- distanced self talk i.e. use my name or pronouns like you, he, she. This works
  because it changes perspective. Its similar to the batman effect where if a
  child is stuck on something hard, you have them imagine they're batman and
  what batman would do.
- nature walks. This draws our attention to nature and promotes a sense of awe
  (I'm in the presenece of something vast that I can't explain), changing my
  perspective and making my concerns smaller.
- tidy up office
- chatter advisors that help give perspective.
