Courage to be disliked is a book that explains Adlerian psychology. It
does so in the form of a dialog, between a student and a master. Here
are the various ideas I got from reading the book:

Etiology vs Teleology
---------------------

- Add quote
- Discuss the differences between teleology and etiology giving
examples.
- Provide context for improvement.

Weakness and Strength
---------------------

- Discussion pursuit of superiority and feeling of inferiority
- Discuss inferiority complex and superiority complex
- Discuss about weakness and feeling special.

Life Tasks
----------
- Discuss about the general tasks list
- Discuss about separation of tasks
- INterference and being used

Courages
--------
- Quote on meaning of life
- Discuss courage to be disliked
- Discuss courage to be happy
- Discuss courage to be normal


Etiology is the focus on the past, and how it resulted in what has
happened now.
Teleoglogy is the focus on the now, trying to find out the why of
various occurences.

Etiology can lead to self determinism, where ones life is already
determined by events that occured in the past.

The general idea is to focus on now, and try to find the reasons behind
various behaviours. For example, if someone shouts at someone, one might
blame the anger, whereas in actuality the person intended to make the
other person submit to him, and so created the anger to achieve this
objective. This can be better seen when a parent is scolding their
child, and receives a phone call from someone. The parent seems to keep
their anger somewhere else, finishes the phone call calmly and then
picks it up again

Courage to be disliked
Courage to be normal

Strive to have horizontal relationships and not vertical ones.
Encouragement: the idea of accepting one self as is, and the taking the
necessary steps to go forward in life.
