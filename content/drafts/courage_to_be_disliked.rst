Courage to be disliked is a book that explains Adlerian psychology. It
does so in the form of a dialog, between a student and a master. Here
are the various ideas I got from reading the book:

Etiology vs Teleology
---------------------
When someone focuses on the past, and uses past experiences and events
to explain what has currently happened, this is known as Etiology. The
text is heavily against this, since it provides an easy way out of
various problems that occur in life. The book however emphasizes on
teleology, which is where one focuses on the now, and tries to find out
why various things have happened. A good example of this is when one
goes to the doctor, who doesn't try to figure out what past event caused
some disease, but rather focusses on the current symptoms and treating
the current ailment.

The biggest problem with etiology however, is that it can lead to self
determinism. This is where one will believe that how their life
progresses has already been determined by events in the past, and that
nothing can change this.

Teleology also provides a new insight into various events. A good
example provided is that of anger and individuals. People tend to blame
some reactions on their anger, as though it was a separate entity from
themselves. However, anger is a tool that is used by the individual to
achieve some said task. A good example of this is when a mother is
angrily scolding their child. If the mother receives a phone call,
she'll put the anger away and calmly receive the call. Afterwards, she
becomes angry again and continues to scold the child. This shows that
the mother is using anger as a tool against her child.

Teleology also provides a means of understanding various lifestyle
decisions. People tend to remain in their lifestyle because they're
comfortable and can predict things really well. Their lifestyle may also
provide good reasons for some decisions they have made. For example,
someone who dreams of becoming a novelist yeat their job keeps them too
busy. A teleological explanation of why the novelist doesn't quit would
be that s/he is using the job (instead of quiting) because he is
actually afraid of criticism of his novel or that s/he may produce
inferior writing. Later on in their lives, they will use the reason of
old age for this too.


Weakness and Strength
---------------------
Another key idea discussed is superiority and inferiority. Key emotions
that tend to help people become better are the feeling of inferiority
and the pursuit of superiority. These tend to make one to become better,
and to strive to grow. However, when these feelings become a hindrance,
they develop into complexes. The inferiority complex occurs when one
uses their feelings of inferiority as an excuse in life.
For example, one can claim that they cannot be successful because they
are uneducated, and therefore won't try to overcome this obstacle. The
superiority complex is whereby one has the feeling of inferiority but
doesn't have the strength to strive for growth. They compensate for this
by associating with people or things they feel are superior e.g. some
brands of clothes or some celebrities.

Another thought is that weakness makes one strong and powerful. For example,
the baby can control the parents because it is weak. SOme people tend to
cling to their weaknesses so as to get some hold of people. If someone
tries to help them overcome their weakness, they use the fact that the
other party cannot possible understand their feelings as a deterrent.
However, in doing so, they become slaves to their weaknesses and end up
unable to survive without this.

Life is not a competition with winners and losers. This is because if
competition is at the core of one's interpersonal relationships, one
will start viewing people as enemies who must not be underestimated.
Also when having a discussion with someone, the moment it becomes a
power struggle, one should step down. This is because the conversation
has derailed from that of providing information/opinion to that of
winner and losers. Also, avoid criticizing the other party just because
you think you're right, otherwise the conversation will degenerate into
a power struggle.

Life Tasks
----------
Another interesting concept introduced in the book is that of tasks. An
individual has three main classifications of tasks:
- Task of friendship
- Task of work
- Task of love

Separation of tasks is whereby one decides to what point one's own tasks
go, and from which point are tasks another persons. Once this is done,
one should do their own tasks to the best of their ability, and only
lend a hand to others when needed. However, one should be careful not to
encroach on another person's territory.

Someone has to be careful about tasks, making sure that they do not
infringe in another person's tasks. A good way of figuring out who
should perform a task is to ask who will eventually benefit from the
task being done.

Another interesting take on tasks is in believing in someone. It is your
task to believe in someone. How the other person behaves with regard to
this belief is their task.

It is also your task to live your life the best way your believe in. The
judgement passed by people about your life is not your task. This
therefore means you are free to do as you please. In fact, freedom is
being disliked by other people. This is because it is proog that one is
living life as they would please, and not trying to satisfy others. Thus
the courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked.

Furthermore, if a task is beyond one's capability, one needs to accept
this and move forward in doing what one can do (self acceptance) thus
one avoids lying to oneself. This is counter to self affirmation, where
one uses phrases like 'I can do it', when something is cleary beyond
one's ability. A good example for this is in exams, where if someone
fails they will either say 'I was unlucky this time' (self affirmation)
or accept what they got and try to improve for the next exam (self
acceptance).

Courage to be normal.

The greatest life lie of all is to not live here and now. It is to look
at the past and the future, cast a dim light on one's entire life and
believe tha one has been able to see sth.

Life in general has no meaning. Whatever meaning life has must be
assigned to it by the individual.
