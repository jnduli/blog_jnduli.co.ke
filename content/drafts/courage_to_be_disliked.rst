Courage to be disliked is a book that explains Adlerian psychology. It
does so in the form of a dialog, between a student and a master. Here
are the various ideas I got from reading the book:

Etiology vs Teleology
---------------------
.. - Add quote
.. - Discuss the differences between teleology and etiology giving
.. examples.
.. - Provide context for improvement.

When someone focuses on the past, and uses past experiences and events
to explain what has currently happened, this is known as Etiology. The
text is heavily against this, since it provides an easy way out of
various problems that occur in life. The book however emphasizes on
teleology, which is where one focuses on the now, and tries to find out
why various things have happened. A good example of this is when one
goes to the doctor, who doesn't try to figure out what past event caused
some disease, but rather focusses on the current symptoms and treating
the current ailment.

The biggest problem with etiology however, is that it can lead to self
determinism. This is where one will believe that how their life
progresses has already been determined by events in the past, and that
nothing can change this.

Another advantage of focussing on the why is that it provides a new
insight into various events. A good example provided is that of anger
and individuals. People tend to blame some reactions on their anger, as
though it was a separate entity from themselves. However, anger is a
tool that is used by the individual to achieve some said task. A good
example of this is when a mother is angrily scolding their child. If the
mother receives a phone call, she'll put the anger away and calmly
receive the call. Afterwards, she becomes angry again and continues to
scold the child. This shows that the mother is using anger as a tool
against her child.


Weakness and Strength
---------------------
..
.. - Discussion pursuit of superiority and feeling of inferiority
.. - Discuss inferiority complex and superiority complex
.. - Discuss about weakness and feeling special.

Another key idea discussed is superiority and inferiority. Key emotions
that tend to help people become better are the feeling of inferiority
and the pursuit of superiority. These tend to make one to become better,
and to strive to grow. However, when these feelings become a hindrance,
they develop into complexes. The inferiority complex is when one cannot
strive beyound their feeling of inferiority, using this as an excuse.
For example, one can claim that they cannot be successful because they
are uneducated, and therefore won't try to overcome this obstacle. The
superiority complex is whereby one has the feeling of inferiority but
doesn't have the strength to strive for growth. They compensate for this
by associating with people or things they feel are superior e.g. some
brands of clothes or some celebrities.

Another thought is that weakness makes one feel special. For example,
the baby can control the parents because it is weak. SOme people tend to
cling to their weaknesses so as to get some hold of people. If someone
tries to help them overcome their weakness, they use the fact that the
other party cannot possible understand their feelings as a deterrent.
However, in doing so, they become slaves to their weaknesses and end up
unable to survive without this.

Life Tasks
----------
- Discuss about the general tasks list
- Discuss about separation of tasks
- INterference and being used

Courages
--------
- Quote on meaning of life
- Discuss courage to be disliked
- Discuss courage to be happy
- Discuss courage to be normal


Etiology is the focus on the past, and how it resulted in what has
happened now.
Teleoglogy is the focus on the now, trying to find out the why of
various occurences.

Etiology can lead to self determinism, where ones life is already
determined by events that occured in the past.

The general idea is to focus on now, and try to find the reasons behind
various behaviours. For example, if someone shouts at someone, one might
blame the anger, whereas in actuality the person intended to make the
other person submit to him, and so created the anger to achieve this
objective. This can be better seen when a parent is scolding their
child, and receives a phone call from someone. The parent seems to keep
their anger somewhere else, finishes the phone call calmly and then
picks it up again

Courage to be disliked
Courage to be normal
Community feeling
Life tasks and separation of tasks
Avoid reward / punishement in tasks
Life lies
Life is like a series of dots not a line
Avoid power struggles.
Strive to have horizontal relationships and not vertical ones.

necessary steps to go forward in life.
