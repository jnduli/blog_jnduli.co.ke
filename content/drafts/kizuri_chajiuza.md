`Kizuri chajiuza, kibaya chajitembeza` is a swahili proverb that translates to
`the good sells itself, whereas the bad walks around`. I understood this as good
things always attract the correct people e.g. customers go to good products or
jobs land on good employees, but this is a naive read of the proverb. There
should be a balance between good and marketing and they both work together. For
example, if you spend too much time and money making a great product, you won't
have enough for marketing and an inferior one will beat you to the market.

<!-- look for bias where bad make a lot of noise crowding the good -->


I've naively held this belief, even if I didn't consciously know of it. Its held
various forms in my life like:

- I'll be so good that employers will come chasing me for a job.
- I'll write the best code that ...
- I'll do anonymous donations ....
- I don't need a network because my track record speaks for itself


I'm not saying that we don't put in the effort to improve ourselves, rather that
we should also aim to improve our selling skills. I'm far off from this but
trying to become better at it.

I'm saying we need to take an active, and not passive approach to selling
ourselves.
