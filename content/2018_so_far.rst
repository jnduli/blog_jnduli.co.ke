This year so far has been tough.

I thought I would have read around 10 books by now but I'm barely
half that mark. Most of the books are mostly fiction, but at least
I've got some variety this time. The books I've completed so far
are:

+ 'The Worthing Saga' by Orson Scott Card: This is a really
  interesting read, although I disagree with what I think is the
  core message of this book. This is that someone has to suffer so
  that they can enjoy life fully, otherwise their lives are empty.
+ 'Deep Work' by Cal Newport: This has to be the best book I've
  read this year. It will be even better if I can manage to put
  the advice in this book into practice. It explains the concept
  of concentrating on one's work and the advantages it adds to
  one's life. This concept comes with various examples of people
  that have applied deep work in their practice to successful
  extents.
+ 'The Princess Bride' by William Goldman: The feel-good-book of
  the year. The story just flows and its told in a weird way where
  the author occassionally adds commentary to provide context or
  sometimes give spoilers in the book.
+ 'Lauren Ipsum' by Carlos Bueno: This book is aimed at kids but
  is really awesome. Its various puns and analogies to computers
  were really cool.
+ 'The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time Book 2)' by Robert Jordan: This
  series does get really interesting in book 2. The first book was
  a bit dull but this picks up the pace to tell a great tale of
  the Dragon.

Some books I've started reading but yet to complete are:

+ 'Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming' 
  by Brian Lonsdorf: This explains functional programming concepts
  using javascript. This has to be the book that got me interested
  in functional programming, especially when the author explained
  currying and composing. That was literally mind-blowing.
+ 'LearnYouAHaskell' by Miran Lipovaka: Decided to learn a purely
  functional language after getting through some chapters of
  Mostly Adequate. I'm barely done with the third chapter and I'm
  reall liking this way of thinking.


I haven't blogged as much as I thought I would this year.
Basically the idea was to blog on what I was doing so that it
acts a means of documentation for my future self. I find it easier
to read my own words especially when its from a concept I had
forgotten about. The good thing is I have a lot of new things I've
learned, so I really need to pull up my pants. Some topics I've
really got into include:

+ Robotics: I'm thinking of making a javascript tool that will do
  the forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, robotic dynamics
  (Euler-Lagrange and Newton-Euler) and motion planning. I think
  doing this will cement the knowledge I've got a bit more.
+ Functional programming: Not sure of what to do, but I think I'll
  look for a pet project that I can implement using haskell.
+ Model Predictive Control and Advanced Control: These are some
  really dope units I'm doing in my Master's program. Its mostly
  theoretical, but I have to find something practical to use these
  in. I mean, just thinking about these concepts puts a smile to
  my face.
+ Hybrid Energy Systems: This is what I want to focus on for my
  Masters' thesis though I'm still looking for a gap here.

For the `comic site <http://comics.jnduli.co.ke>`_, I just
realized my art isn't that good. I think this has to do with
self-bias, where immediately after drawing something, I looked at
it and saw that it was good. But months later (when the feeling of
achievement has waned), I look at them objectively and I'm shocked
that I found them good. I've been looking at various videos and
trying to practice. This is something I intend to become better
at.

I'm also in my second semester for masters in Mechatronics
Engineering. The course work is pretty interesting but difficult.
The killer feature though is the research work, more specifically
the research proposal. This becomes more impossible with every
passing day especially finding a viable gap. I had some things I
really wanted to get into, so I started digging in and reading
papers. I ended up (still do) frustrated and angry at myself
because I mostly couldn't understand these papers. And when I
finally get a paper I somehow understand, I can't find any gap to
fill. This has been going on for the past three months and its
maddenning. I've thought that there must be a better way to do
this, but this is the process my institution takes. I get my own
gap, and write a proposal around it (with barely any feedback or
help). So right now I'm just shooting in the dark and hoping
something comes up.

For personal projects, `Mradi <mradi.jnduli.co.ke>`_ is coming up
nicely. Development has slowed down though in recent months.
Hopefully I will manage to finish this product soon. I also started
working on some financial tool called Staafu. It should basically
help one plan for retirement by maximizing investments and
reducing risks.
