Summary: This details how to change the colour of menu item in
mincss

## MinCss ##
So I want to make this pelican template that is really light
weight. I decided to go with mincss since they are really small
and support a wide range of browsers.

Problem I encounter is that I decided that my menu background in
colour. However, by default mincss menu is black with a menu icon
that is black in colour. 

So I thought they used an icon or image, only to find out mincss
has this really neat treat of using borders. The following line
shows its implementation:

<!--TODO include codes of its implementation-->

To make it appear well in my theme, ie. in a white background with
black lines, I changed the code to this.

<!--TODO include code changes of the implementation-->
