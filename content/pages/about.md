## Who Am I? ##

I am a lover of technology. I like linux, vim and open source
tools. I'm also really into hardware design. I can make electrical
circuits and mechanical stuff. Which is why I did Mechatronics in
University. 

And then there's books. I love books (reading them btw). I love
movies too.

## WHY THE BLOG ##

This is a blog that is used to self document the problems I
experience while working in my environments of choice. 

I usually work on a wide range of technologies and sometimes I
find a fix here and there that needs to be recorded for future
purposes.

Also it will work as a place to let my opinions loose. Perhaps on
a book here, a movie there, some policy, etc.

## WHY PELICAN ##
The main reason for using pelican is because I'm a vim fan. Being
a vim fan means I like using the terminal a lot. I do most of my
work from the terminal, so why not just add blogging too.

## DISCLAIMER ##
Please keep this in mind while reading the blog:

_Stuff just is. My mental model of how the world works is incomplete. It has boundaries. I'm constantly relearning stuff. That, there, is the thing. Knowing that I'm limited in how I perceive stuff. There is strength in these "limits" though, they enable you to filter noise and make decisions. ~ Bonface Munyoki_
