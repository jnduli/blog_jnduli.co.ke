# WHO AM I? #
Well, I am a recent graduate. I believe I have great skills,
problem is, I did not invest time in showing them off. Thats part
of the reason I am creating this blog, to show off ... hehe.

## WHY THE BLOG ##

This is a blog that is used to self document the problems I
experience while working in my environments of choice. 

I usually work on a wide range of technologies and sometimes I
find a fix here and there that needs to be recorded for future
purposes.

## WHY PELICAN ##
The main reason for using pelican is because I'm a vim fan. Being
a vim fan means I like using the terminal alot. I do most of my
work from the terminal, so why not just add bloggin too.
