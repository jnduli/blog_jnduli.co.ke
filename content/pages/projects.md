This contains a list of projects I'm currently working on:

1. [Letter theme](https://github.com/jnduli/letter_theme): This is the
   pelican theme used on this blog.
2. [Staafu](https://github.com/jnduli/vue-retirement): A vue js project that predicts future returns of simple and
   compound interest accounts, providing an estimate for retirement if
   expenses are provided. 
3. [Comic Server](https://github.com/jnduli/comic_server): This is the
   engine behind [my comic site](https://comics.jnduli.co.ke/).
4. [Python curses games](https://github.com/jnduli/python_curses_games):
   I'm trying to implement some games from the terminal. So far snake
   and tetris work well.
